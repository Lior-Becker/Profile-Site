                     applicationn. This was built as a final university project.
                      My personal contributions consist of handling the integration pipeline,
                       unit testing, infinite world generation, and the physics of the world.

                    Another university project, however this is a full 3D game built in pure javascript using the three.js rendering engine. My personal contributions consist of world physics, player movement,
                     creating in the heads up display and the apis required to for that to be interactive, server hosting, and creating the interactive minimap.

                    I built this in my spare time with the intention of making the perfect snake AI.
                     In this casee a hamiltonian cycle is generated which the snake follows allowing the snake to win the game every single time.</p>
