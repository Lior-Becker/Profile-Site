                <p id="text">
                    At 23, I've dedicated a significant part of my life to my passion for technology.
                     This commitment drove me to earn an honors degree in computer
                      science from the University of the Witwatersrand. Now, as a junior
                       software engineer and graduate at BBD, I'm eager to apply and expand my 
                       skills in this dynamic field.
                </p>
                <p id="text">

                    Motivated by curiosity, I've dabbled in a variety of programming languages, 
                    a journey that's really leveled up my skills as a programmer. Moreover, I am 
                    well-acquainted with collaborating in
                     teams, a skill honed over years of university experience.
                </p>
                <p id="text">

                    Beyond the realm of coding, I find joy in immersing myself
                    in captivating fantasy worlds through video games and
                    tabletop gaming. This passion serves as a testament to my
                    love for creativity and imaginative exploration.

                <p id="text">
                    Looking ahead, my enthusiasm 
                    drives me to continue growing in every conceivable 
                    way, with a particular focus on advancing my expertise
                    in Web development. I'm excited about the challenges and 
                    opportunities that lie ahead, as I strive to make meaningful
                    contributions to the dynamic landscape of technology.

                 I am a very passionate person, and when I discover something I enjoy,
                  I like to delve into it to gain a comprehensive understanding. This often 
                  leads to one interest sparking another. I've consistently been drawn to video
                   games, especially those that allow for creative expression like Minecraft, 
                   or ones with immersive worlds and challenging gameplay, such as the Dark Souls
