                <p id="text">
                    At 23, I've dedicated a significant part of my life to my passion for technology.
                     This commitment encouraged me to earn an honors degree in computer
                      science from the University of the Witwatersrand. Now, as a junior
                       software engineer and graduate at BBD, I eager to apply and expand my 
                       skills in this dynamic field.
                </p>
                <p id="text">

                    Motivated by curiosity, I have dabbled in a variety of programming languages, 
                    a journey that leveled up my skills as a programmer. Moreover, I collaborate well
                    within teams, and have been collaborating with my peers throughout both my university degrees.
                </p>
                <p id="text">

                    Beyond the realm of coding, I enjoy delving into 
                    fantasy worlds through video games and
                    tabletop gaming, displaying my 
                    passion for creativity and imaginative exploration.

                </p>
                <p id="text">

                    I intend to continue my own personal growth,
                    with a particular focus on advancing my expertise
                    in web development. I am excited about the challenges and 
                    opportunities that lie ahead, as I strive to make meaningful
                    contributions to the dynamic landscape of technology.

                 I am a very passionate person, and when I discover something I enjoy,
                  I like to delve into it to gain a comprehensive understanding. This often 
                  leads to one interest sparking another. I have consistently been drawn to video
                   games, especially those that allow for creative expression like Minecraft, 
                   or ones with immersive worlds and challenging gameplay, such as the Dark Souls

                  When those games did not run smoothly on my family's computer,

                      interest and passion for technology, both in terms of 
                      hardware and software

                      my hand at creating them. This is why I enjoy it so much.
